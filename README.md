# PyEcoreOCL: OCL to Python compiler

This project aims to provide an Object Constraint Language (OCL) to Python compiler.
The project is based on the work of [Anthony Beuchey](https://github.com/Beuchey) that wrote a [textX](https://github.com/textX/textX) grammar and a set of wrappers that enables OCL api on Python objects.
