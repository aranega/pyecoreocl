# PyEcoreOCL: OCL to Python compiler

This project aims to provide an Object Constraint Language (OCL) to Python compiler.
The project is takes inspiration on the work of [Anthony Beuchey](https://github.com/Beuchey) that wrote a [textX](https://github.com/textX/textX) grammar for OCL and a set of wrappers that enables OCL api on Python objects, as well as on the work of [CrossEcore](https://github.com/crossecore) about the grammar for [OCLInEcore](https://github.com/crossecore/oclinecore).
